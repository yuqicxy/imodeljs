# Hierarchies-related ECExpressions

## Rule Condition

Child node rules have a `condition` ECExpression property which defines which rules should
be applied for which parent nodes. The following ECExpression symbols are available there:

| Symbol | Type | Value
|---|---|---
| `ParentNode` | [NavNode context](../ECExpressions.md#navnode) | The parent NavNode expression context.

Additionally, [Ruleset variable symbols](../ECExpressions.md#ruleset-variables-user-settings)
are available as well.

## Instance Filter

ECExpressions that are specified in `instanceFilter` specification properties
are converted to ECSQL WHERE clause, so they have some limitations - ony a subset
 of all the ECExpression symbols are available.

The below table lists all of them:

| Symbol | Type | Value |
|---|---|---
| `parent` | [ECInstance context](../ECExpressions.md#ecinstance) | The parent ECInstance expression context.
| `this` | [ECInstance context](../ECExpressions.md#ecinstance) | ECInstance expression context of the ECInstance that's currently being handled.

Additionally, [Ruleset variable symbols](../ECExpressions.md#ruleset-variables-user-settings)
are available as well.

## Specification

Symbols available in expressions evaluated at each node's level (e.g. `hideExpression`):

| Symbol | Type | Value
|---|---|---
| ThisNode | [Node context](../ECExpressions.md#navnode) | NavNode expression context of the ECInstance that's currently being handled.
| this | [ECInstance context](../ECExpressions.md#ecinstance) | ECInstance expression context of the ECInstance that's currently being handled.

Additionally, [User Settings symbols](../ECExpressions.md#symbols-in-global-context) are available as well.
