# CalculatedProperties Content Modifier

This content modifier allows including additional calculated properties into the content.

## Attributes

Name | Required? | Type | Default | Meaning
-|-|-|-|-|-
`label` | Yes | `string` | | Label of the calculated property. Supports [localization](../Localization.md).
`value` | Yes | [ECExpression](../ECExpressions.md) | | Expression to calculate the value. The expression can use [ECInstance](../ECExpressions.md#ecinstance) and [Ruleset Variables](../ECExpressions.md#ruleset-variables-user-settings) symbol contexts.
`priority` | No | `number` | `1000` | Priority of the property. Determines the position of this property in UI components - higher priority means the property should be more visible.

## Example

```JSON
{
  "priority": 9999,
  "label": "@MyApp:Volume@",
  "value": "this.Width * this.Height * this.Depth"
}
```
