# Rules and Recommendations

The following rules and recommendations [rec.] should be honored when devising BIS names. This include Domain, Schema, Namespace, Class and Properties names as well as aliases.

*NOTE: The items below are not ordered by importance but rather around related concepts.*

## General

_BIS naming convention is deliberately more restrictive than EC naming: All BIS names are valid EC names but not all EC names are valid BIS names._

|   | Description | Note |
|---|-------------|------|
| Rule | Only use alphanumeric characters | |
| Rule | Do not use an underbars in names | Don't use underbars even if it aids readability: Use `OrderLineItem` not `Order_LineItem`|
| Rule | Names may not start with a number | E.g. `3dGeometry` is not allowed |
| Rule |  Names may not differ only by case | E.g. If there's already a name called `Pricelist` then you may not define a new one called `PriceList` |
| Rule | Use PascalCase names | PascalCase means words are concatenated with the first letter of each word capitalized. E.g. `OrderLineItem` |
| Rule | Use United States Spelling | E.g. `Organization` not `Organisation` |
| Rec. | Use the most widely accepted and descriptive name possible | Consult the current thesaurus before creating new words. |
| Rec. | Use a single word that describes the entity | E.g. `Person` rather than `HumanBeing` |
| Rule | Don't add superfluous terms | Don't use two nouns if one can equally express its meaning.<br><br>E.g. `Vehicle` rather than `TransportationVehicle`.<br><br>For relationships we can often infer the type of target from the name of the source. So, use `PhysicalElementIsOfType` rather than `PhysicalElementIsOfPhysicalType` (because the element cannot be of any type other than Physical!)|
| Rec. | Do not add any unnecessary prefixes or suffixes to an entity | Especially terms like `Object`, `Instance`, `Entity`, and `Property`.<br><br>E.g. Use `Note` not `NoteEntity` (for a class name) or `NoteProperty` (for a property name). |
| Rec. | Words should be less than 30 characters | |
| Rec. | Use abbreviations and acronyms with care | Use abbreviations and acronyms only where they are common and completely unambiguous. If the abbreviation/acronym is not well known, don't use it!<br><br>Try to limit the use to those that appear in the list of [abbreviations and acronyms](#abbreviations-and-acronyms) and don't use those listed in the "don't use" section.<br><br>Two letter acronyms have both letters capitalized, provided that each letter represents a different word.<br><br>E.g. `UI` ("User Interface") and `IO` ("Input/Output") because both words are capitalized, but `Db` because "Database" is _one compound word._<br><br>Three or more letter acronyms have only the first letter in capital case.<br><br>E.g. `Html` or `Guid`<br><br>Abbreviations of a single word have only the first letter in capital case.<br><br>E.g. `Id` ("Identification") |
| Rec. | Use numbers with care | Avoid names such as `One21` and `Door2Door`<br><br>A well-known exception is for terms `1d`, `2d`, and `3d` (dimensions). These may be used to form new terms provided they don't break the rule stating that [Names may not start with a number](#names-may-not-start-with-a-number).<br><br>E.g.Acceptable names are `Spatial1d`, `Model2d` |
| Rec. | Use special words with care. | Specifically, make sure that the semantic meaning of the special term is well understood._<br><br>E.g.`List`, `Item`, `Set`, etc...<br><br>_See [list of special terms](#list-of-special-terms)_<br><br>If it isn't an `Aspect`, don't put `Aspect` in the name. |
| Rule | Do not use New, Old, Tmp, or Temp | What seems "new" when you do it will become "old" when you make the next change. |
| Rec. | Avoid the use of 'Base' in class names | E.g. use `RasterModel` instead of `RasterBaseModel` |
| Rec. | Avoid using the organization's name | If prefixes are needed, give preference to the domain rather than the organization.<br><br>E.g. Use `TransportElement` rather than `ExorElement` |
| Rec. | Avoid using product names | E.g. Avoid prefixes like `eB`, `OpenPlant`, `STAAD`, `Dgn`, `ConnectedProject` |
| Rec. | Avoid domain names in the term | E.g. `PlanningElement`, `ConceptualElement`, `PlantElement`, `PlantArea`, and `Area` |
| Rec. | Avoid using version numbers or generation names |E.g. `V8iFile` |
| Rec. | Favor instances over definitions | I.e. if you need to distinguish between an Entity Definition and an Entity Instance and there are no suitable words that can distinguish them, suffix the definition rather than the instance: user will work with instance more often than definitions_<br><br>E.g. Use `AttributeDefinition` for the definition and `Attribute` for the value.<br><br>**Note:** The ECProperty is an example where this recommendation is not being followed. There are no plans to change that - Sorry. |

## ECSchema / BIS Domain Names

|   | Description | Note |
|---|-------------|------|
| Rule | All EcSchema/BIS Domain Names must be registered with BIS workgroup to avoid conflicts.<br>This includes the aliases. |E.g. `BisCore` (schema name) and `bis`<br><br>See [list of BIS Schemas](../domains/index.md) |
| Rule | BIS Schema aliases must be in lowercase | |
| Rule | BIS Schema aliases must be less than 7 characters long | |

## Class

|   | Description | Note |
|---|-------------|------|
| Rule | Use singular form | E.g. `File` not `Files`|
| Rule | When combining terms, arrange them in increasing order of significance|E.g. `CableCar`, `AnalogWaterMeter`<br><br>**Exceptions:** `2d` and `3d` because names can't start with numerals |
| Rec. | Names of direct or indirect specializations of `bis:ElementAspect` should end with `Aspect`.|
| Rec. | Do not use prepositions such as `Of`, `With`, `On`, `An`, `In`, `From`, etc... | |

## Property (including “Navigation” Properties)

|   | Description | Note |
|---|-------------|------|
| Rule | Use the plural form of the name when the attribute is a collection, otherwise use the singular form. | `Document.AddedBy` (a document can be added by a single person) but can have many notes, so `Document.Notes` |
| Rec. | Try to create attributes with the same name as their underlying type | `Document.Lock` is of type `Lock`<br><br>**Exception:** When the entity has more than on attribute of that type, or when it aids in readability: `Document.AddedBy` instead of `Document.Person` |
| Rec. | Don't include the primitive datatype (int, string) with the name | **Exception:** Dates. Since `Date` is both a data type and a more meaningful noun, something like `DateAdded` would be acceptable but `NoteBlob` would not be. |
| Rule | Don't include the attribute owner name in the attribute name | E.g. `Document.Id` not `Document.DocumentId` and `Person.Name` not `Person.PersonName` |
| Rule | Prefix Boolean names with `Is`, `Has`, `Can`, `May` | E.g. `IsUnderChange`, `HasOtherRevision`, `MayChange` |
| Rule | When the field represents a bit mask, use the plural form of the word|E.g. `StateHints`, `HasFlags` |
| Rule | For `NavigationProperties`, prefer to use the name of the related `ECClass` as the property name | If further qualification is needed, consider prefixing words from the role label. |

## Relationship

|   | Description | Note |
|---|-------------|------|
| Rule | Use Source-Verb-Target | E.g. `ParentHasChild`, `OrganizationSellsProduct`<br><br>In most cases, the "source/target" will simply be the name of the object. In those cases, the addition of an adjective can be helpful: `Child` in `ElementHasChildElement` |
| Rule | (Picking up on the previous rule)<br>_Don't use conjunctions.  Do not use a singular noun or verb, even if it clearly defines a relationship.<br>Always use noun-verb-noun | E.g. Don't use `Marriage` or `ManAndWoman`; use `PersonIsMarriedToPerson` |
| Rule | The relationship name should indicate the cardinality. |The source is always singular and the target indicates multiplicity.<br><br>E.g. `ElementOwnsChildElement` (1:N), `ElementHasLinks` (N:N), `PhysicalElementIsOfType` (N:1) |
| Rec. | Use the full class names for source. For the target, use the 'role' within the relationship. | E.g. `PhysicalElementIsOfType` |
| Rec. | Use verbs that imply relationship "strength" with care | Especially with regard to EC where:<br>- `Owns` or `Contains` implies embedding<br>- `Shares` implies holding<br><br>_See [list of relationship strengths](./standard-relationship-strengths-names.md)_ |
